        <h2>Support</h2>
        <p>
          From crisis referrals to food assistance and mental health check-ins, we help individuals and families access the support they need.

        <h2>Empowerment</h2>
        <p>
          We run inclusive programmes that build skills, grow confidence, and open doors — especially for young people and underrepresented voices.
