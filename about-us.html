      <h2>Welcome from Karen</h2>
      <p>
        Hello and welcome to the Roe Valley Residents Association. I’m Karen, and I’m proud to be part 
        of a team that believes in the power of local voices and grassroots action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, we've seen what happens when people come together to share ideas, listen to one 
        another, and take action. RVRA was built on that belief — that everyone deserves to feel heard, 
        included, and supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're here to learn more, get involved, or seek support, we're so glad you're here. 
        We’re always just a phone call or knock on the door away.
      </p>
      <p class="karen-signoff">– Karen, Project Manager</p>
